needed:

- for each question, take out the surplus characters given by the user


Later:
- do load game function
- do save game function

Done:
- finish the reveal_cells function and check if it works
- create a function to count the number of flags on the board
- add a number of bombs left in the print_board function according to the number of flags on the board
- do check_win function
- add understand minuscule letters in choosing a cell
- change the functions that ask choices to the user to use char to avoid errors, and then usually convert it to int
- invert row and columns, so the column is the first asked as that is the most intuitive (seen later that it is not true)
- play again screen
- instead of two questions (play or save and then reveal or flag) in players turn, give them three options (reveal, flag or save)
- when revealing a 0 in a cell, even if the cell next to it is a flag it should reveal the cell
- free the boards, once the player has won or lost
- ask play again in a function, to avoid repeating code
- don't allow the player to flag a cell that is already revealed
- in the case where the player has placed too many flags, tell them that they have placed too many flags
- easy difficulty, take off the difficulty word
- number of flags on the board
- letters before the numbers in the board
- add colors to the numbers and flags in order to make the game more visually appealing and easier to understand
- for the numbers above 10 find a way to understand them and not 10 as 1 and 0 -> string with scanf an then convert into int with atoi function
